Choices:
identityhashmap is used to keep track of classes visited.
Values for fields or those in arrays are not inspected until the entire class is inspected (BFS type of way).
hierarchy traversal is done in a DFS type way.

known issues:
1. recursion ends but goes probably too far. Certain java library classes are inspected multiple times...
2. interfaces of classes in fields are not properly found/parsed. It is an issue with field parsing.
